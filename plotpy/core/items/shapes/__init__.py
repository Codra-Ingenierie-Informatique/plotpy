plotpy.core.items.shapes
---------------------------

The `shapes` module provides geometrical shapes:
    * :py:class:`.shapes.PolygonShape`
    * :py:class:`.shapes.RectangleShape`
    * :py:class:`.shapes.ObliqueRectangleShape`
    * :py:class:`.shapes.PointShape`
    * :py:class:`.shapes.SegmentShape`
    * :py:class:`.shapes.EllipseShape`
    * :py:class:`.shapes.Axes`
    * :py:class:`.shapes.XRangeSelection`

A shape is a plot item (derived from QwtPlotItem) that may be displayed
on a 2D plotting widget like :py:class:`.baseplot.BasePlot`.

.. seealso:: module :py:mod:`.annotations`

Examples
~~~~~~~~

A shape may be created:
    * from the associated plot item class (e.g. `RectangleShape` to create a
      rectangle): the item properties are then assigned by creating the
      appropriate style parameters object
      (:py:class:`.styles.ShapeParam`)

>>> from plotpy.core.items.shapes import RectangleShape
>>> from plotpy.core.styles import ShapeParam
>>> param = ShapeParam()
>>> param.title = 'My rectangle'
>>> rect_item = RectangleShape(0., 2., 4., 0., param)

    * or using the `plot item builder` (see :py:func:`.builder.make`):

>>> from plotpy.core.builder import make
>>> rect_item = make.rectangle(0., 2., 4., 0., title='My rectangle')
