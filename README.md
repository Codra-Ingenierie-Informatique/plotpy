‚ÑπÔ∏è Created in 2016 by Pierre Raybaut and maintained by the [PlotPyStack](https://github.com/PlotPyStack) organization.

‚ÑπÔ∏è `plotpy` is the new major release of [`guiqwt`](https://github.com/PierreRaybaut/guiqwt): same team üèãÔ∏è, same goal üéØ, same long-term support ‚è≥.

## Overview

`plotpy` is is a Python library providing efficient 2D data-plotting features
for interactive computing and signal/image processing application development.
It is part of the [PlotPyStack](https://github.com/PlotPyStack) project, aiming at
providing a unified framework for creating scientific GUIs with Python and Qt.

`plotpy` is based on:

* [Python](http://www.python.org) language and [Qt](https://doc.qt.io/) GUI toolkit (via [PySide](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/) or [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro))
* [guidata](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/guidata) automatic GUI generation library
* [PythonQwt](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PythonQwt) plotting widgets library
* [NumPy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/NumPy) and [SciPy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SciPy) scientific computing libraries

Based on PythonQwt and on the scientific modules NumPy and SciPy, plotpy is a
Python library providing efficient 2D data-plotting features (curve/image
visualization and related tools) for interactive computing and signal/image
processing application development.

the library and [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for recent history of changes.

### Features

The `plotpy` library also provides the following features:

* Ready-to-use [plot widgets and dialog boxes](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/plot/index.html)

* [pyplot](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/pyplot.html): interactive plotting widgets, equivalent to `matplotlib.pyplot`, at
  least for the implemented functions

* supported [plot items](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/items/index.html): curve, image, histogram, label, shape, annotation, ...

* interactive features:

  * multiple object selection for moving objects or editing their
    properties through automatically generated dialog boxes

  * item list panel: move objects from foreground to background,
    show/hide objects, remove objects, ...

  * customizable aspect ratio for images

  * tons of ready-to-use tools: plot canvas export to image file, image
    snapshot, interval selection, image rectangular filter, etc.

  * curve fitting tool with automatic fit, manual fit with sliders, ...

  * contrast adjustment panel for images: select the LUT by moving a range selection
    object on the image levels histogram, eliminate outliers, ...

  * X-axis and Y-axis cross-sections: support for multiple images, average
    cross-section tool on a rectangular area, ...

  * apply any affine transform to displayed images in real-time (rotation,
    magnification, translation, horizontal/vertical flip, ...)

* application development helpers:

  * ready-to-use [plot widgets and dialog boxes](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/plot/index.html)
  * load/save graphical objects (curves, images, shapes)
  * a lot of test scripts which demonstrate `plotpy` features (see [examples](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/examples.html))
